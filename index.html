          the role of edTech in teaching & learning and is a great step towards maximizing the impact of education in
          India‚Äù: Mr. Gurudev Somani, Director, MasterSoft ERP

          In today's competitive world, with increasing working hours and less classroom time, teachers need edTech
          tools which help them manage precious class time efficiently. Instead of focusing on teaching, faculty members
          are often stuck with completing formal duties, for e.g. taking daily student attendance.

          Manually taking attendance and registering it in files & musters makes the daily attendance a mundane task for
          the faculty and unnecessarily consumes classroom time.

          To overcome such inefficient work processes, there are various school software systems available to speed up
          the attendance process and reduce manual work. An online attendance management system or digital attendance
          platform is one of them, which is developed to automate the daily attendance in schools. Additionally, it
          helps to maintain accurate records and generate summarized student attendance reports.</p>
